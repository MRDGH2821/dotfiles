# AGENTS Instructions

This file provides guidance for AI coding assistants working with this project.

If none of the skills or tools specified in `.config/mise/config.toml` are available, run the following commands and alert the user to reload the agent.

```sh
mise trust
mise install
mise run prepare
```

Refuse to do anything until `mise run prepare` has run atleast once and the agent is reloaded with the skills & MCP servers as specified in `capabilities.yaml`.
MCP servers should be accessible via Capa MCP.

description: Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Use when writing, reviewing, or refactoring code to avoid overcomplication, make surgical changes, surface assumptions, and define verifiable success criteria.

# Karpathy behavioral guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Engineering Guidelines

- Explain the intended change, state material assumptions, and clarify ambiguous requirements.
- Read the relevant code and configuration before editing; reuse existing functionality.
- Inspect the working tree and preserve changes made by the user or other agents.
- Match existing style and keep every changed line within the requested scope.
- Define how to verify the change, run the relevant checks, and review the final diff.
- Report what changed, which checks ran, and any failures or checks you could not run.

## Commit policy

### Branch naming strategy

Before creating a branch, follow the branch naming strategy in the project-root
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (`#branch-naming-strategy`).

### Commit Messages

Every commit MUST be atomic (one logical change), and every commit message MUST use Conventional Commits format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`.
Consult `cog.toml` for valid scopes and release hooks; it is the source of truth.

Version bumps use cocogitto (`cog bump`). Inspect the configured hooks before
running a release command.

## AI-generated artifact locations

- For agent-plugin artifacts, use the plugin's dedicated subdirectory under `docs/` when it has one; keep its contents there (for example, `docs/superpowers/`).
- If the plugin instead stores artifacts in a repository-root directory, move/use `.agents/<plugin-id>/` (for example, move `paad/` to `.agents/paad/`).
- For other AI-generated artifacts, use `.agents/<artifact-type>/`, such as `.agents/logs/` for AI work logs or `.agents/research/` for research.

## Agent instruction sources

Edit this file for shared guidance. Use other files in
`.config/capabilities/instructions/` for project-specific context and
`.config/capabilities/rules/` for shared policies.

After editing these sources, run `mise run ai-setup` when `capabilities.yaml`
exists. Otherwise, keep corresponding `AGENTS.md` sections in sync. Keep
editable sources outside `.agents/rules/`; Capa prunes that generated directory.

### Conditional guidance

Read the relevant rule before acting:

- Branching or committing: `.config/capabilities/rules/commits.md`.
- For an AI-assisted commit, also read `.config/capabilities/rules/ai-co-author.md`.
- Recording AI-assisted work: `.config/capabilities/rules/ai-logs.md`.
- Reviewing on behalf of a human: `.config/capabilities/rules/ai-reviews.md`.
- Using mise or hk, or running project checks: `.config/capabilities/rules/tooling.md`.

### Dependencies

Prefer lightweight, cross-platform dependencies. Use the project's package
manager, update relevant configuration and lockfiles, and document installation.

### Verification and documentation

If no relevant test or check exists, verify behavior directly. Update
documentation when setup or behavior changes.
<!-- capa:end:__base__ -->

<!-- capa:start:template-context -->
## Generated project context

Inspect source files, dependency manifests, and configuration to learn the project's purpose, architecture, and commands. Treat overview documentation as advisory; verify its claims against those maintained sources.

### Template updates

Use `copier update` to apply template updates, then review the resulting changes.

### Recommendations

When implementing a tool, CLI, or library that reads its own configuration, consider the `.config/` recommendation in `README.md`. Verify its fit against maintained source and configuration before following it.
