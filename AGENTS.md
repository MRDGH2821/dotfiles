# AGENTS Instructions

This file provides guidance for AI coding assistants working with this project.

## Project Context

- **Project Type**: Template repository for minimal project setup
- **Key Technologies**: pre-commit hooks, MegaLinter, prek
- **Purpose**: Provides a standardized starting point for new projects with quality checks

## General Guidelines

### Communication

- Explain what you're doing and why before making changes
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Provide context for decisions, especially when multiple approaches exist

### Code Quality

- Follow existing code style and conventions in the project
- Run linters and formatters before committing changes
- Ensure all changes pass pre-commit hooks

### File Operations

- Always check if a file exists before attempting to modify it
- Use appropriate tools to search for files rather than guessing paths
- Preserve file formatting and structure unless explicitly asked to change it

## Dev Environment Tips

- Use `--help` or `help` subcommand to get help on a command. It can even reveal hints on how to proceed ahead or optimize the number of steps.
- Check tool documentation before asking the user for configuration details

## Pre-commit Hooks (prek)

### Installation

- Install with `uv tool install prek` and run checks via `prek --all-files`
- Enable the hooks with `prek install --install-hooks` so they run automatically on each commit

### Working with Hooks

- If a pre-commit hook fails, read the error message carefully - it often suggests the fix
- Run `prek --all-files` before committing to catch issues early
- Some hooks auto-fix issues (like formatters); others require manual intervention

## Linting and Formatting

### MegaLinter

- Configuration is in `.mega-linter.yml`
- Run locally with: `npx mega-linter-runner --flavor documentation`
- Check reports in `megalinter-reports/` directory
- Not all linters need to pass - some are informational

### CSpell (Spell Checking)

- Configuration is in `.cspell.json`
- Add project-specific words to the `words` array
- Don't disable spell checking without good reason
- Both file content and commit messages are spell-checked

### Prettier

- Configuration is in `.prettierrc.json`
- Formats markdown, JSON, YAML files
- Auto-fixes on pre-commit

## Commit Messages

### Format

- Follow Conventional Commits format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>` as given here - <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>
- Valid types: `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`
- Valid scopes: `zed`, `vscode`, `cspell`, `megalinter`, `precommit`
- For additional scopes, refer `conventional-pre-commit` hook in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. It has additional scopes and is the source of truth.

### Examples

```txt
feat(precommit): add spell checking to commit messages
fix(cspell): resolve configuration issue
docs: update AGENTS.md with guidelines
chore(cspell): add technical terms to dictionary
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Pre-commit hooks failing on commit:**

- Run `prek --all-files` to see all issues at once
- Fix formatting issues first (Prettier, whitespace)
- Then address spell checking and linting

**Spell check failures:**

- Add legitimate technical terms to `.cspell.json` `words` array
- Use proper capitalization for proper nouns
- Don't add obvious typos to the dictionary

**Template syntax errors:**

- Ensure template syntax is valid before committing
- Check for missing closing tags or brackets
- Test template rendering if applicable

### Getting Help

- Most tools support `--help` flag for detailed usage
- Check tool documentation before modifying configurations
- Review existing configuration files for examples

## Best Practices

### Before Making Changes

1. Understand the current state of the project
2. Check if similar functionality already exists
3. Review relevant configuration files
4. Consider impact on users who will use this template

### When Adding Dependencies

- Prefer tools that don't require heavy installation
- Document installation steps clearly
- Consider cross-platform compatibility
- Update relevant configuration files

### Testing Changes

- Run all pre-commit hooks: `prek --all-files`
- Verify the project structure is correct
- Test on a clean environment if possible
- Ensure documentation is updated
